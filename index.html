            <h3> Chart Junk #1 </h3>
            <p>
                This particular diagram is posted on Instagram by LoverOfGeography. The data source for the diagram can
                be obtained from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_human_height_by_country">Wikipedia</a>
            </p>

            <h3><span class="red">What</span> is the data like?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Countries in Europe
                </li>
                <li>
                    Average male height in Europe 2022 (in cm)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><span class="red">Why</span> did they do the visualisation?</h3>
            <p>It is likely that the designer want to showcase the data in a geo-visualisation for <b>easier
                    consumption</b>. Arguably, you can say geo-visualisation can attract more attention on Instagram as
                well</p>

            <h3><span class="red">How</span> did they designed the visualisation?</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Idiom: Geo-Visualisation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data Scale: Ratio
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criticism on idiom (technique involved)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Poor Use of Identity Channel (Color).</b> In the diagram, the designer used <span
                        color="pink">pink</span> and <b>black</b> to identity the countries with the shortest gang and
                    the tallest gang respectively. However, there seems to be no meaning for the default color <span
                        color="teal">teal</span>? Hence, this can be considered a poor use of the identity color as this
                    can be illustrated through other means
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Poor Use of Magnitute Channel (Font Size)</b> At first glance, you might think that the
                    font-size is associated with the average male height (e.g. bigger = taller). However, this
                    is a poor use of font-size as the various font-size does not encode any information and is
                    used to solely fit the information onto the map
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Poor Use of Magnitute Channel (Tilt)</b> This is similar to the point made in the above section.
                    There is no meaning to the tilt degree of the font.

            <h3><span class="red">What</span> is the data like?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Name of various MMOs
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pricing Fairness Score for each MMOs
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><span class="red">Why</span> did they do the visualisation?</h3>
            <p>The purpose is to unveil the price fairness of each MMORPG. To a certain extent, it is trying to rank
                and compare the price fairness of each MMORPG </p>

            <h3><span class="red">How</span> did they designed the visualisation?</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Idiom: Bar Chart
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Poor Use of Identity Channel (Color).</b> The designer probably wanted to separate the price
                    fairness into bands and showcase them in different colors. However, it is not entirely necessary to
                    use the color channel to encapsulate this information. Also, there is no legend for the chart.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Bar Chart could be better utilised.</b> If the intention is to rank and compare the price
                    fairness across various MMOs, what the designer could do minimally is to rank the MMOs in terms of
                    their price fairness score. Since the X axis does not contain any order information, it is
                    entirely possible to do so.
